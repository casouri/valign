This package provides visual alignment for Org tables on GUI Emacs. It can properly align tables containing variable-pitch font, CJK characters and images. In the meantime, the text-based alignment generated by Org mode is left untouched.

To use this package, load it and run =M-x valign-setup RET=. And any Org tables in Org mode should be automatically aligned. If you want to align a table manually, run =M-x valign-table RET= on a Org table.
